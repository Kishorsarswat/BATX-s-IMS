Although, I had shared a document which had some basic information regarding my IA, 
here are some things you would want to know regarding what I have planned: 

- The idea is to develop a stock management system for a client to record the types of 
	products, raw materials and basic information about both. 
- I will have to develop a database for both products (batteries) and its raw materials. 
- After the database is developed, I will have to make a software, which will have its own GUI.
	The basic intent of the software is to find and display data from the database,
	edit information about products and raw materials, delete information, and add new information. 

And hence the software will have the following modules: 
- Module #1: displaying already available information in the database.
- Module #2: editing information in the database, including deleting, changing and adding.
