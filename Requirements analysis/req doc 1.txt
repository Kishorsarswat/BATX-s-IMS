## Defining the problem:
My client, Mr. Utkarsh, has recently started his own firm. The business model is to buy back used
batteries, recycling the materials from these batteries, develop new batteries using the recycled
materials and finally distribute them into the market through the distributor channels, who would
further sell the product to market retailers. The waste materials which are extracted during the
process are sold off to make additional profits.
Presently, the business manually notes down all the raw materials used to make their products.
This is a very time consuming process which affects the overall efficiency of the firm. Not only
this, but the firm experienced irregularities in maintaining the stock record for all the raw materials
as there was data loss due to mishandling of records by the employees. This led to the production
of batteries with the wrong raw materials used, causing consumer dissatisfaction and product
expectations not being met.
The recent growth of the business and its sales has led to record keeping being even more
problematic for my client.
I proposed a solution to this problem by offering the firm with a software which would replace the
traditional methods of record keeping by hand. The software would determine the type and
quantity of materials needed for the production of their product as well as display, modify, delete
and add data.

## Rationale for the proposed system:
After much consideration, I chose to make a software (object-oriented programming), in
conjunction of a database, rather than only having a database to perform the task. This is
because the project would require complex logic and a graphical user interface. This kind of
interface would make it faster and more interactive for my client to solve his problem. Having to
edit data in a database wouldn’t be efficient, as the solution should automatically perform tasks of
adding, deleting and modifying information on raw materials.
I chose to use Java as my programming language because:
- the language will allow me to develop a GUI with buttons and icons (high interactivity).
- it is free to use and no licensing is required.
- the language is platform independent, which means that Java code runs on any machine that
doesn’t need any special software to be installed
I chose to use MS Access for database manipulation because:
- it is quick and easy to create database systems
- this software is well-known and supported by majority of applications.
- data structures can be formed and normalisation can be done through multiple tables.
